# TextGameEngine_Test
Just messing around with a test project to see about fleshing out a text game engine.

There was no real direction outside of testing out interseting ideas.  

Ex: 
-- text coloring
-- player and enemy objects
-- modifying player stats
-- player inventory
-- add/remove inventory
-- basic attack sequence
-- similar keys being bound by different states

This is not the best way, or even most correct, but an expandable idea platform of sorts.
